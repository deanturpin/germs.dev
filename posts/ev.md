Observations and tips, with a focus on my own experiences with a [Tesla Model Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y).

## Comparison of charger powers

> DC power = voltage x current

Note the supercharger is DC and uses those two large pins at the bottom of the connector.

| Description  | Power | Current | mph  | Voltage |
|---           |---    |---      |---   |---      |
| Wall plug    | 2.3kW |         | 8    | 240V    |
| Lampost      | 3.7kW | 16A     | 14   | 240V    |
| Home         | 7.4kW | 32A     | 28   | 240V    |
| 3-phase      | 11kW  |         | 42   |         |
| 3-phase      | 32kW  |         | 42   |         |
| Supercharger | 250kW | 520A    | 648  | 480V    |

- [CCS2 "Combo 2"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Charging_System) (Combined Charging Connector) -- what a design this is!
- IEC Type II -- the normal one you'll see everywhere
- [CHAdeMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAdeMO) -- weird one that you need an adapter for

## Cleaning

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT0iEZCcmNA

- ONR
- Two buckets
- Sponge
- Wheel cleaners
- Tyre cleaners
- Microfibre
- Karcher car cleaning
- Two buckets with ONR

## Full wash

- Tar and bug remover
- P&S brake buster
- Old wheel cleaning brush
- Green bristle brush for rims
- Hyrdro-sylx ceramic window cleaner

## Big red sponge method

For regular washing of light dirt, via [Jeremiah Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_9_0ElVChU).

- 2 x 5 gallon buckets with grit guard (Chemical Guys)
- Optimum No Rinse (ONR)
- Spray bottle
- Big red sponge with slits: if it's a new sponge, soak it in ONR for 24 hours
- Microfibre towels (edgeless and tagless)
- 300gsm MF for wheels
- Sealant or wax (Optiseal) -- every three to six months
- Optimum car wax regularly
- Distilled water
- Top to bottom, front to back: least dirty to most dirty
- Don't wipe in circles! Horizontally only on one side of the sponge, very lightly, then other side of sponge, then rinse
- Once panel is done, dry with MF towel (light coloured waffle weave to highlight dirt)
- Or dry with Optiseal, two sprays per panel, start wiping where you sprayed (500gsm MF towel)
- Last two panels should be rocker panels and back bumper

### Tyres and wheels

- Rims: spray with ONR and wipe with MF towel (200gsm)

### To keep in the car

- Spray bottle with ONR mixture
- MF towel (500gsm)
