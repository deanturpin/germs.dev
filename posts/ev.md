## Comparison of charger power

> Power = Voltage x Current

However, domestic voltage is, of course, 240V; so does this mean the actual power is a little higher? Note the supercharger is DC.

| Description | Power | Current | Voltage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lampost | 3.5kW | 16A | 233V (AC) |
| Home | 7kW | 30A | 219V (AC) |
| Supercharger | 250kW | 520A | 480 (DC) |
