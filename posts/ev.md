Observations and tips, with a focus on my own experiences with a [Tesla Model Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y).

## Comparison of charger powers

> DC power = voltage x current

Note the supercharger is DC and uses those two large pins at the bottom of the connector.

| Description  | Power | Current | mph  | Voltage |
|---           |---    |---      |---   |---      |
| Wall plug    | 2.3kW |         | 8    | 240V    |
| Lampost      | 3.7kW | 16A     | 14   | 240V    |
| Home         | 7.4kW | 32A     | 28   | 240V    |
| 3-phase      | 11kW  |         | 42   |         |
| 3-phase      | 32kW  |         | 42   |         |
| Supercharger | 250kW | 520A    | 648  | 480V    |
