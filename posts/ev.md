## Comparison of charger power

> Power = Voltage x Current

However, domestic voltage is, of course, 240V; so does this mean the actual power is a little higher?

| Description | Power | Current | Voltage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lampost | 3.5kW | 16A | 233V (AC) |
| Home | 7kW | 30A | 219V (AC) |
| Supercharger | 250kW | TBC | TBC (DC) |
