# Logic Pro

Requirements for a Logic Pro laptop.

## My question

> Long time user with a big gap, looking to get back into it. I worked a lot with versions 6, 7, Express... Thinking about a MacBook Pro but not sure how much to spend. I always seemed to be fighting the CPU in the past, but does modern Logic make use of the more capable graphics cards on the top tier laptops?

## Responses

> I am currently working on a song with about 100+ channels, loaded with 3'rd party plugins and the processing is not even at 50%
Macbook Pro M2, 32 gb ram.
> Logic itself doesn't make much use of the GPUs. There is a company which hopes to change that (GPU AUDIO) - but at the moment, Logic is 99% CPU/RAM dependent. (once a file/sound is loaded from storage)
> I’d disagree on some older machines. But with intel machines and multiple displays it made a huge difference, especially if you were scaling resolutions. I had a maxed out mini at one point that need an eGPU just to have Logic play nicely with two 27” screens. Only one and all the issues went away. It was well documented by other users when I researched it trying to troubleshoot. The apple silicon doesn’t seem to have any of the same issues, and they all have far more powerful GPU built in than any intel machines dreamed of.
