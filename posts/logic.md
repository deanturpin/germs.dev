# Logic Pro

Selecting a laptop for running Logic.

## My question

> Long time user with a big gap, looking to get back into it. I worked a lot with versions 6, 7, Express... Thinking about a MacBook Pro but not sure how much to spend. I always seemed to be fighting the CPU in the past, but does modern Logic make use of the more capable graphics cards on the top tier laptops?

> I am currently working on a song with about 100+ channels, loaded with 3'rd party plugins and the processing is not even at 50%
Macbook Pro M2, 32 gb ram.
> Logic itself doesn't make much use of the GPUs. There is a company which hopes to change that (GPU AUDIO) - but at the moment, Logic is 99% CPU/RAM dependent. (once a file/sound is loaded from storage)
> I’d disagree on some older machines. But with intel machines and multiple displays it made a huge difference, especially if you were scaling resolutions. I had a maxed out mini at one point that need an eGPU just to have Logic play nicely with two 27” screens. Only one and all the issues went away. It was well documented by other users when I researched it trying to troubleshoot. The apple silicon doesn’t seem to have any of the same issues, and they all have far more powerful GPU built in than any intel machines dreamed of.

## Apple store

So I had a chat to an actual user at the Apple Store in Brighton.

We agreed that the £1500 Air was the same spec as the £2000 Pro (bar HD size), but the Pro has a bit more connectivity (extra USB-C and HDMI) and a "low impedence" headphone socket for my posh cans (which I normally use with a USB DAC, but I might just go dirty Bluetooth on my travels anyway). The Pro also has fans but he said he'd never heard them spin whilst using Logic: hoist with his own petard, perhaps?

## Specs

### Air

- 8-Core CPU
- 10-Core GPU
- 16GB Unified Memory
- 512GB SSD Storage footnote

## DACs

- Currently got [this one](https://www.audioquest.com/dacs/dragonfly/dragonfly-cobalt)
- Is the Pro built-in DAC as good as a decent external?
