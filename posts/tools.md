# Watchmaker's tools
I bought a kit to get started but I've upgraded much of it. I've mostly been
working on 1960-80s manuals and automatics with a central seconds hand. And I'm
a leather strap kind of person so not much work with bracelets.

There are endless tools that can streamline your workflow, so I've listed them
in order so you can add as you progress. And tools can be resold quite easily
if you've gone far enough to scratch the itch. The rabbit hole goes _deep_!

Always try to use the correct size screwdriver. You just risk chewing up the
blades, screw head or both.

Very short tweezers are good for manipulating screws, can be flipped around
with one hand.

## Servicing
Servicing usually goes hand-in-hand with the strip-down and repair but it can
also start to become quite expensive; not only in the machines but consumables
that you probably can't sell on quite as easily.

But do consider an ultrasonic cleaner, like [this
one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DK-SONIC-Household-Ultrasonic-Eyeglasses/dp/B08S6V52MV/).
Very reasonably priced and cool to use!

### Degreaser
- Lighter fluid (readily available from a newsagent £2.99)
- Renata essence £8

### Lubrication
A very complicated business, but basically you need:
- A light oil for the quickest moving parts (jewels)
- A slightly heavier oil for the metal-on-metal parts
- And a grease on the high-friction components (e.g., keyless works).

- Moebius 9010 for jewels
- Dropper red (fine)
- Moebius 9501 grease for high friction parts
- Dropper green (large)

See the [Moebius lubrication table](https://www.moebius-lubricants.ch/sites/default/themes/moebius/extras/pdf/tableEN.pdf).
