# Watchmaker's tools
I bought a kit to get started but I've upgraded much of it. I've mostly been working on 1960-80s manuals and automatics with a central seconds hand. And I'm a leather strap kind of person so not much work with bracelets.

There are endless tools that can streamline your workflow, so I've listed them in order so you can add as you progress. And tools can be resold quite easily if you've gone far enough to scratch the itch. The rabbit hole goes _deep_!

## Servicing
Servicing usually goes hand-in-hand with the strip-down and repair but it can also start to become quite expensive; not only in the machines but consumables that you probably can't sell on quite as easily.

- Mainspring winder

### Degreaser
- Lighter fluid

### Oil
A very complicated business but basically you need a light oil for the quick moving parts (jewels) and a heavier oil for the metal-on-metal parts. You can even go for a grease on the heavy friction components (keyless works).

- 9010 high delicate
- HP 1300 mid
- 9501 low - grease
- D5 for the barrel
