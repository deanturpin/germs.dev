# C++ experience and side-projects
Commercially I develop using C++14/17, so I maintain various side-projects on
GitLab to explore C++20/23 features that can't be used at work. These projects
cover topics such as audio processing, trading strategy back-testing and Companies House analysis.

I'm an advocate of ad-hoc scripting for rapid development of ideas, and I
believe a solid foundation in a ubiquitous language such as Bash is essential
in CI and cloud computing. I also have an interest in a more functional
approach to programming offered by template metaprogramming and languages such
as Haskell.
