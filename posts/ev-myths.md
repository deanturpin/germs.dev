# EV myths and misconceptions

It's odd that you have to be armed with counter arguments for owning a electric car. But here we are! Information has been gathered from various sources -- references at the end -- and then paraphrased by me; and it basically serves as a personal crib sheet.

## EVs don't use green energy

It is true that the UK's energy mix is not 100% green. But an ICE vehicle can never be 100% green. Ever. If you have solar you could be charging your car with 100% green energy right now.

In fact, if you have a nearby supercharger, the [Tesla network](https://www.tesla.com/en_gb/impact/product) is 100% renewable.

> With more than 45,000 Superchargers, we own and operate the largest fast charging network in the world. Our global network had 99.95% uptime and was 100% renewable in 2022, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching.

## The infrastructure isn't there

80% of EV drivers charge *at home*. I've never been able to make petrol in my flat so this is a freedom I didn't appreciate until I owned an EV.

## Hybrids are a good compromise

In fact they are worst of both: you have the maintenance cost and pollution of ICE and you won't get into the EV mindset. It will at best be an occasional charging novelty and the usual trips to the garage.

All or nothing.

## EVs aren't cheaper to run

On *the worst possible tariff* a full charge will cost approximately the same as a full tank.

For instance, a Tesla Model Y Long Range has a 82 kWh battery, and if I paid 61p per unit on an expensive lamppost charger, it would cost £50.02 to charge from empty. A realistic range is 300 miles, so that's 16.7p per mile; and similarly, a small petrol car might cost roughly £50 for a tank and also achieve 300 miles.

But, you can get get home tariffs that cost 10p per unit, making it £8.20 for a "full tank". Now we are talking about 2.7p per mile: an eighth of the cost of fuel.

## You use the road, you should pay road tax

> "I pay my road tax"

Actually you don't as road tax was abolished in 1937. What you pay is "Vehicle Excise Duty" -- which is still incorrectly referred to as "road tax" -- and it was introduced by Tony Blair to incentivise buying smaller engines. It's a tax on *cars* not roads: i.e., nothing to do with wearing the roads out. However, rather than tax fuel directly -- which would have probably caused an uprising -- it was based on car *emissions*: a "pollution tax", if you will. And all the bands are defined by CO2 emissions: zero emissions resulting in £0 tax. Until 2025.

The measure being introduced in 2025 removes the £0 Band A bracket, to order to "equalise the treatment" of ICE and EV. And also removes one of the incentives to go electric.

It aligns with the current government's weakening of the green agenda. (And sadly, similarly, the shadow cabinet.)

The move is predicted to boost the Treasury's coffers by £500m per year from 2025.

> The government will continue to use the tax system to support the transition to electric vehicles, including using favourable first-year VED rates for the lowest-emission cars; favourable Company Car Tax rates for low-emission vehicles, and through generous first year capital allowances for zero-emissions cars and vans as well as for EV chargepoint equipment. The government will also continue to support the transition to EVs more broadly, including through the continuation of the plug in van grant and banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2030.

## The grid couldn't handle everyone charging at once

EV adoption is gradual and the grid has seen a *drop* in demand over the last two decades due to energy efficient appliances such as low energy bulbs.

## EV batteries can't be recycled

EV batteries are readily recyclable and are being used in second life applications such as home energy storage.

## Cold weather 1: EV drivers will die in their cars in a snowstorm

ICE vehicles are also affected by the weather and the only reason they are warm is because they are so inefficient. Teslas even have a "camp mode" which is *designed* to let you live in your car with the aircon on for days. You can also schedule your departure time so the car is defrosted when you set off.

## Cold weather 2: EVs have a shorter range in winter

Very true. All batteries are affected by the cold.
