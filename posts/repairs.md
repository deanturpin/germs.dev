# Watch repairs

## Molnija 3602
Consolidating two pocket watches. Could just put the good balance in the second but the first has the cool wolf case, the second is a bit smaller but the dial and hands are in good condition. Actually the second runs well just after swapping in the good balance -- approx. 270&deg; amplitude -- perhaps it's worth just putting this movement into the wolf case?

### Serial 998652
- [x] Measure bezel: 42.6mm 
- [x] Replace fourth wheel
- [x] Fit ratchet wheel screw
- [x] Order new 42.8mm crystal (next largest I could find)
- [ ] Fit new crystal -- crystal press not large enough!
- [ ] Fit working balance
- [ ] New hands
- [ ] New dial

### Serial 594243
Broken balance and good hands. Case much newer but not as nice as the wolf one. Full hunter.

- [x] Reseat click

## Rone Countryman
34mm manual, ~200&deg; ammplitude. Consolidate with a similar Rone with a date. Thinking I'll just initially take the barrel from the second one. Might consider using the second with the date as the donee if it's looking OK after a clean.

### No date version
Runs for a couple of hours but the mainspring seems to be broken.

- [x] Polywatch
- [x] New strap -- black Milanese bracelet
- [ ] New cannon pinion -- evaporated during tear down
- [ ] New mainspring -- slips after a few winds
- [ ] New gasket
- [ ] Service

### Date version
Extremely dirty and smells of rabbits (apparently been in a loft). Appears to have been dipped in grease.

- [x] Clean dial
- [ ] Clean and service

## Omega 131.019 gold-plated
30463681 (1970), cal 601, worn crown, 43-hour power reserve, crystal is loose, case back is a mess!

Crystal size: &#x2300; 30.8mm, 3.5mm height. Very strong running so might not service it.

## Longines 12.92
Hands a little fragile, no case, 27.8mm. I found a 16-jewel version with a wobbly balance to use as a donor, so basically I'll make one good one out of the two. Might be easier just to stick the good balance in the 16-jewel.

### Issues
#### 15-jewel
Serial 4,929,243 (1930).

- [x] Clean dial
- [ ] Remove broken stem
- [ ] Fit missing ratchet wheel

#### 16-jewel
Serial 5,107,778 (1932), broken balance but otherwise movement is OK.

- [x] Clean dial -- not very effective
- [x] Find new case -- from SR
- [ ] Replace hands?
