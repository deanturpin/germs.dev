# Watch repairs

## Omega 131.019 (steel)
22M serial (1965), cal 601 non-runner, arrived in a case for an automatic, has some homemade case clamps.

- [x] Buy correct NOS case for movement
- [x] New mainspring  
- [x] Order new 30.8mm crystal
- [x] Fit new crystal
- [x] Ultrasonic clean of keyless works
- [ ] Only achieving approx. 170&deg; amplitude, try oiling the jewels
- [ ] Trial fit brand new seconds hand (could be too shiny compared to old hands)

## Cauny dress watch
Non-runner, balance OK, stem very difficult to get remove, rolled gold bracelet, broken mainspring, movement [FHF 63](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&0&2uswk&FHF_63).

- [x] Remove from case -- pop the front
- [x] Clean dial -- didn't make much difference
- [x] Check if it runs by turning barrel
- [ ] Replace mainspring -- ordered another movement
- [ ] Service

## Molnija 3602
Consolidating two pocket watches. After swapping various bits it seems both balances are wobbly. So perhaps a dirty balance bridge has broken the good balance? Might be a case of cleaning both and building a new one out of the best bits.

OK, scratch that... it's quite expensive to buy a new balance so I've bought another working movement and a NOS marriage case. Gonna be sweet!

See [Ranfft](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&2&2uswk&Molnia_3602) and [Linux Focus](http://cgi.linuxfocus.org/~guido/molnija-pocket-watch/) for movement details.

### Serial 998652
Awesome forest scene case, broken fourth wheel.

- [x] Measure bezel: 42.6mm 
- [x] Replace fourth wheel
- [x] Fit ratchet wheel screw
- [x] Order new 42.8mm crystal (next largest I could find)
- [ ] Fit new crystal -- crystal press not large enough!
- [ ] Clean pallet fork before fitting new balance
- [ ] Fit working balance
- [ ] New hands
- [ ] New dial

### Serial 594243
Broken balance, good hands, case much newer but not as nice as the wolf one, full hunter, pallet bridge has crazy big screws in it, ran overnight after swapping in a good balance (but only in face down position)

- [x] Reseat click

## Rone Countryman (11.5''')
34mm manual, ~200&deg; amplitude. Consolidate with a similar Rone with a date. Was originally just going to take the barrel from the second one, but now considering using the second with the date as the donee if it's looking OK after a clean.

OK, swapped the good barrel into the original no date version but I couldn't get the wheel train bridge back on and _maybe_ broke the pivot on two escape wheels. Sadness. However, fortunately the ST96 is a very common movement so I have another couple of spares and repairs ones on the way.

Just to get something wearable, let's just got a running ST96 in the original Rone case. 

### FHF ST 96-4 (date) -- 1970
Extremely dirty and smells of rabbits (apparently been in a loft). Appears to have been dipped in grease.

- [x] Clean dial
- [ ] Clean and service
- [ ] Measure crystal
- [ ] Replace crystal

### FHF ST 96 (no date) -- 1965
Runs for a couple of hours but the mainspring appears to be broken. And it's not going back together nicely: train wheel feels scratchy when the bridge is tightened down.

- [x] Polywatch
- [x] New strap -- black Milanese bracelet
- [ ] New cannon pinion -- evaporated during tear down
- [ ] New mainspring -- suspect broken spring, slips after a few winds
- [ ] New gasket
- [ ] Service

## Citizen 2800A
- Time drifts, quite erratic
- 180&deg; amplitude

- [ ] Review keyless works
- [ ] Service
- [ ] Replace main spring (gets very low amplitude on a low wind)
- [ ] Bezel has a gap
- [ ] Grease gasket

## Longines 12.92
Hands a little fragile, no case, 27.8mm movement, 26mm dial. I found a 16-jewel version with a wobbly balance to use as a donor, so basically I'll make one good one out of the two. Might've been easier to just to stick the good balance in the 16-jewel, but it seems both balances are a little wobbly. Will service and try again.

See (Longines serial numbers](https://millenarywatches.com/longines-serial-number/).

### Issues
#### 15-jewel
Serial 4,929,243 (1930).

- [x] Clean dial
- [x] Remove broken stem
- [x] Fit missing ratchet wheel -- took wheel and barrel (with mainspring) from the other one
- [ ] Service
- [ ] Refit good balance

#### 16-jewel
Serial 5,107,778 (1932), broken balance but otherwise movement is OK.

- [x] Clean dial -- not very effective
- [ ] Find new case

## Timex
Keeps great time, 40-hour power reserve, 180&deg; amplitude

## Borgel trench watch 24 9
Marvin 362, 29.5mm; bezel &#x2300; 30.2mm. Bezel measured thrice: 30.17, 30.21, 30.24. So I went for a 30.4mm crystal and it was a success.

- [x] Order 30.4mm crystal
- [x] Polish silver
- [x] Replace crystal
- [x] Order donor movement for practice/spares
- [ ] Rachet wheel is missing a tooth, still works but might replace from donor for completeness
- [x] Pusher has come loose during cleaning -- fits in OK anyway
- [ ] Service
- [ ] Repair original strap -- see [leather conditioner](https://www.watchobsession.co.uk/blogs/watchobsession-blog/how-to-care-for-leather-watch-strap)

## Omega 131.019 gold-plated
30463681 (1970), cal 601, worn crown, 43-hour power reserve, crystal is loose, case back is a mess, very strong running so might not do a full service.

- [x] Replace case back
- [x] Trial refitting old crystal -- cracked it
- [x] Present on new leather strap
- [x] Order new crystal: &#x2300; 30.8mm, 3.5mm height
- [x] Fit new crystal
- [ ] Measure amplitude 
- [ ] Partial service of keyless works

## Raketa 2609.HA
From 1975, in good condition and running well. Measured 47h power reserve (nominally 45h) -- see [Ranftt](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&2&2uswk&Raketa_2609_HA). Dial brightened up with a little with water and cottonbud, also removed some of the gunk on the [chapter ring](https://www.watch-wiki.net/doku.php?id=chapter_ring).

- [x] Check power reserve
- [x] Clean dial
- [ ] Ultrasonic clean
- [ ] Lubricate
