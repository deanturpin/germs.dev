## Rone Countryman
34mm manual, ~200&deg; ammplitude. Consolidate with a similar Rone with a date. Thinking I'll just initially take the barrel from the second one. Might consider a new mainspring for the second if it's looking OK after a clean.

### Date version
- Extremely dirty and smells of rabbits (been in a loft)
- Looks like it's been dipped in grease
- Chipped dial
- Cracked crystal

### No date version
Runs for a couple of hours but the mainspring seems to be broken.

- [x] Polywatch
- [x] New strap -- black Milanese bracelet
- [ ] New mainspring (slips after a few winds)
- [ ] New gasket
- [ ] Service

22M serial (1965), cal 552, crown very worn, after-market gold-plated bracelet, crown/stem not engaging

- [ ] Service (external)
- [x] New leather strap
- [ ] Add gold-plated Omega buckle

## Omega 131.019 gold-plated
30463681 (1970), cal 601, worn crown, 43-hour power reserve, crystal is loose, case back is a mess!

Crystal size: &#x2300; 30.8mm, 3.5mm height. Very strong running so might not service it.

~270&deg; amplitude.

- [x] Replace case back
- [x] Trial refitting old crystal -- cracked it
- [x] Present on new leather strap

## Longines 12.92
Hands a little fragile, no case, 27.8mm. I found a 16-jewel version with a wobbly balance to use as a donor, so basically I'll make one good one out of the two. Might be easier just to stick the good balance in the 16-jewel.

### Issues
#### 15-jewel (serial 4,929,243 -- 1930)
- Broken stem
- Missing ratchet wheel

#### 16-jewel (serial 5,107,778 -- 1932)
- Broken balance

- [x] Find new case -- from SR
- [ ] Replace hands?

Marvin 362, 29.5mm; bezel &#x2300; 30.2mm.

Bezel measured thrice: 30.17, 30.21, 30.24. So I'm going to try a 30.4mm crystal.

- [x] Order 30.4mm crystal
- [x] Polish silver
- [x] Replace crystal
- [ ] Rachet wheel is missing a tooth: does it matter?
- [ ] Service
- [ ] Repair original strap
