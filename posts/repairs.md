## Borgel trench watch 24 9
Marvin 362, 29.5mm; bezel &#x2300; 30.2mm. Bezel measured thrice: 30.17, 30.21, 30.24. So I went for a 30.4mm crystal and it was a success.

- [x] Order 30.4mm crystal
- [x] Polish silver
- [x] Replace crystal
- [ ] Rachet wheel is missing a tooth, still works but might replace from donor for completeness
- [x] Pusher has come loose during cleaning -- fits in OK anyway
- [ ] Service
- [ ] Repair original strap -- see [leather conditioner](https://www.watchobsession.co.uk/blogs/watchobsession-blog/how-to-care-for-leather-watch-strap)

## Molnija 3602
Consolidating two pocket watches. After swapping various bits it seems both balances are wobbly. So perhaps a dirty balance bridge has broken the good balance? Might be a case of cleaning both and building a new one out of the best bits. See [Ranfft](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&2&2uswk&Molnia_3602) and [Linux Focus](http://cgi.linuxfocus.org/~guido/molnija-pocket-watch/) for movement details.

I've actually ordered a new wristwatch case to fit it in now.

### Serial 998652
- Awesome forest scene case
- Non-runner (broken fourth wheel)

- [x] Measure bezel: 42.6mm 
- [x] Replace fourth wheel
- [x] Fit ratchet wheel screw
- [x] Order new 42.8mm crystal (next largest I could find)
- [ ] Fit new crystal -- crystal press not large enough!
- [ ] Clean pallet fork before fitting new balance
- [ ] Fit working balance
- [ ] New hands
- [ ] New dial

### Serial 594243
- Non-runner (broken balance)
- Good hands
- Case much newer but not as nice as the wolf one
- Full hunter
- Pallet bridge has crazy big screws in it!
- Ran overnight after swapping in a good balance (but only in face down position)

- [x] Reseat click

## Rone Countryman
34mm manual, ~200&deg; amplitude. Consolidate with a similar Rone with a date. Was originally just going to take the barrel from the second one, but now considering using the second with the date as the donee if it's looking OK after a clean.

### Date version
Extremely dirty and smells of rabbits (apparently been in a loft). Appears to have been dipped in grease.

- [x] Clean dial
- [ ] Clean and service
- [ ] Measure crystal
- [ ] Replace crystal

### No date version
Runs for a couple of hours but the mainspring appears to be broken. And it's not going back together nicely: train wheel feels scratchy when the bridge is tightened down.

- [x] Polywatch
- [x] New strap -- black Milanese bracelet
- [ ] New cannon pinion -- evaporated during tear down
- [ ] New mainspring -- suspect broken spring, slips after a few winds
- [ ] New gasket
- [ ] Service

## Omega 131.019 (steel)
- 26M serial (1968), cal 601
- Arrived in an automatic case

- [x] Procure correct NOS case for movement
- [x] New mainspring  
- [x] Order new 30.8mm crystal
- [x] Present on steel sharkskin mesh bracelet
- [x] Fit new crystal
- [ ] Service -- paying particular attention to keyless works (very stiff)
- [ ] Trial fit brand new seconds hand (could be too shiny compared to old hands)

## Citizen 2800A
- Time drifts, quite erratic
- 180&deg; amplitude

- [ ] Present on new strap (stainless steel sharkskin?)
- [ ] Review keyless works
- [ ] Service
- [ ] Replace main spring (gets very low amplitude on a low wind)
- [ ] Bezel has a gap
- [ ] Grease gasket

## Longines 12.92
Hands a little fragile, no case, 27.8mm movement, 26mm dial. I found a 16-jewel version with a wobbly balance to use as a donor, so basically I'll make one good one out of the two. Might've been easier to just to stick the good balance in the 16-jewel, but it seems both balances are a little wobbly. Will service and try again.

See (Longines serial numbers](https://millenarywatches.com/longines-serial-number/).

### Issues
