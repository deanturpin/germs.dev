# Watch repairs

## Molnija 3602
Consolidating two pocket watches. After swapping various bits it seems both balances are wobbly. So perhaps a dirty balance bridge has broken the good balance? Might be a case of cleaning both and building a new one out of the best bits. See [Ranfft](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&2&2uswk&Molnia_3602) and [Linux Focus](http://cgi.linuxfocus.org/~guido/molnija-pocket-watch/) for movement details.

### Serial 998652
- Awesome forest scene case
- Non-runner (broken fourth wheel)

- [x] Measure bezel: 42.6mm 
- [x] Replace fourth wheel
- [x] Fit ratchet wheel screw
- [x] Order new 42.8mm crystal (next largest I could find)
- [ ] Fit new crystal -- crystal press not large enough!

### Serial 594243
- Non-runner (broken balance)
- Good hands
- Case much newer but not as nice as the wolf one

- Pallet bridge has crazy big screws in it!
- Ran overnight after swapping in a good balance (but only in face down position)

- [x] Reseat click

## Rone Countryman
34mm manual, ~200&deg; ammplitude. Consolidate with a similar Rone with a date. Thinking I'll just initially take the barrel from the second one. Might consider using the second with the date as the donee if it's looking OK after a clean.

### No date version
Runs for a couple of hours but the mainspring seems to be broken.

- [x] Polywatch
- [x] New strap -- black Milanese bracelet
- [ ] New cannon pinion -- evaporated during tear down
- [ ] New mainspring -- slips after a few winds
- [ ] New gasket
- [ ] Service

### Date version
Extremely dirty and smells of rabbits (apparently been in a loft). Appears to have been dipped in grease.

- [x] Clean dial
- [ ] Clean and service
- [ ] Measure crystal
- [ ] Replace crystal

## Omega 161.009
22M serial (1965), cal 552, crown very worn, after-market gold-plated bracelet, crown/stem not engaging.

- [x] New leather strap
- [ ] Service (external)
- [ ] Add gold-plated Omega buckle

## Omega 131.019 gold-plated
30463681 (1970), cal 601, worn crown, 43-hour power reserve, crystal is loose, case back is a mess! Crystal size: &#x2300; 30.8mm, 3.5mm height. Very strong running so might not service it.

~270&deg; amplitude.

- [x] Replace case back
- [x] Trial refitting old crystal -- cracked it
- [x] Present on new leather strap
- [x] Order new 30.8mm crystal
- [x] Fit new crystal
- [x] Measure buckle end of strap -- 16mm

##  Omega 131.019 (steel)
26M serial (1968). Cal 601 arrived in an automatic case, so I bought a brand new correct one. Fitted new crystal but the dial doesn't fit through the back of the case! Perhaps this is a front loader?

- [x] NOS case
- [x] New mainspring  
- [x] Order new 30.8mm crystal
- [x] Present on steel sharkskin mesh bracelet
- [x] Fit new crystal
- [ ] Remove movement from gold-plated one and measure dial
- [ ] Replace worn crown
- [ ] Trial fit brand new seconds hand (could be too shiny compared to old hands)
- [ ] Service

## Citizen 2800A
Keeps OK time, 180&deg; amplitude

- [ ] Present on new strap (stainless steel sharkskin?)
- [ ] Review keyless works
- [ ] Service
- [ ] Replace main spring (gets very low amplitude on a low wind)
- [ ] Bezel has a gap
- [ ] Grease gasket

## Longines 12.92
Hands a little fragile, no case, 27.8mm. I found a 16-jewel version with a wobbly balance to use as a donor, so basically I'll make one good one out of the two. Might be easier just to stick the good balance in the 16-jewel.

### Issues
#### 15-jewel
Serial 4,929,243 (1930).

- [x] Clean dial
- [x] Remove broken stem
- [ ] Fit missing ratchet wheel

#### 16-jewel
Serial 5,107,778 (1932), broken balance but otherwise movement is OK.

- [x] Clean dial -- not very effective
- [x] Find new case -- from SR
- [ ] Replace hands?

## Borgel trench watch 24 9
Marvin 362, 29.5mm; bezel &#x2300; 30.2mm.

Bezel measured thrice: 30.17, 30.21, 30.24. So I went for a 30.4mm crystal and it was a success.

- [x] Order 30.4mm crystal
- [x] Polish silver
- [x] Replace crystal
- [ ] Rachet wheel is missing a tooth: does it matter?
    - If so, replace ratchet wheel from donor
- [x] Pusher has come loose during cleaning -- fits in OK anyway
- [ ] Service
- [ ] Repair original strap -- see [leather conditioner](https://www.watchobsession.co.uk/blogs/watchobsession-blog/how-to-care-for-leather-watch-strap)

## Timex
Keeps great time, 40-hour power reserve, 180&deg; amplitude

- [ ] Attempt to bend bend hour hand back
- [ ] Minor service

---

## Accurist Shockmaster
Hand winder G10, keeps great time, 34-hour power reserve.

- [x] Buff case
- [x] Add crocodile leather strap

## Raketa 2609.HA
From 1975, in very good condition and running well. Will probably just give the dial some love and check the power reserve. Measured 47h power reserve (nominally 45h) -- see [Ranftt](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&2&2uswk&Raketa_2609_HA). Dial brightened up with a little with water and cottonbud, also removed some of the gunk on the chapter ring

- [x] Check power reserve
- [x] Clean dial
