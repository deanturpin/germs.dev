## Longines 12.92
Hands a little fragile, no case, 27.8mm. I found a 16-jewel version with a wobbly balance to use as a donor, so basically I'll make one good one out of the two. Might be easier just to stick the good balance in the 16-jewel.

### Issues

- Broken stem
- Missing ratchet wheel

#### 16-jewel (serial 5,107,778 -- 1932)
