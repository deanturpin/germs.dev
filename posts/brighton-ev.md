# EV in Brighton

The street chargers include free parking but there are some inside car parks where you have to pay for both!

Around town most of the street chargers required the [Blink app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ov.electricblue). There are a handful of [rapid chargers](https://electricbrighton.com/charging/rapid), but if you're coming down from London you pass a couple of superchargers at Gatwick.

[Zap Map](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zapmap.zapmap) is the standard app but there's also [Electric Brighton](https://electricbrighton.com/).
