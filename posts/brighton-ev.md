# EV in Brighton

We have a home charger. The street chargers include free parking but there are some inside car parks where you have to pay for both!

Around town most of the street chargers required the [Blink app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ov.electricblue). There are a handful of [rapid chargers](https://electricbrighton.com/charging/rapid), but if you're coming down from London you pass a couple of superchargers at Gatwick.

[Zap Map](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zapmap.zapmap) is the standard app but there's also [Electric Brighton](https://electricbrighton.com/).

## Connectors

- [CCS2 "Combo 2"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Charging_System) (Combined Charging Connector) -- what a design this is!
- IEC Type II -- the normal one you'll see everywhere
- [CHAdeMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAdeMO) -- weird one that you need an adapter for
