HOURS:MINUTES:SECONDS:FRAMES

> timecode and frame rate are not the same thing

- genlock - generator locking

> The solution to this problem is drop-frame timecode, which is sort of like
> leap year for timecode. At 29.97 fps, every minute (except minutes divisible
> by ten), you skip counting the first two frames. You know youâ€™re looking at
> drop frame timecode because the colon between minutes and frames is usually
> replaced by a semicolon.
