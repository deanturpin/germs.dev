For regular washing of light dirt, via [Jeremiah Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_9_0ElVChU).

- 2 x 5 gallon buckets with grit guard (Chemical Guys)
- Optimum No Rinse (ONR)
- Spray bottle
- Big red sponge with slits: if it's a new sponge, soak it in ONR for 24 hours
- Microfibre towels (edgeless and tagless)
- 300gsm MF for wheels
- Sealant or wax (Optiseal) -- every three to six months
- Optimum car wax regularly
- Distilled water
- Top to bottom, front to back: least dirty to most dirty
- Don't wipe in circles! Horizontally only on one side of the sponge, very lightly, then other side of sponge, then rinse
- Once panel is done, dry with MF towel (light coloured waffle weave to highlight dirt)
- Or dry with Optiseal, two sprays per panel, start wiping where you sprayed (500gsm MF towel)
- Last two panels should be rocker panels and back bumper

## Tyres and wheels

- Rims: spray with ONR and wipe with MF towel (200gsm)
