# Banks

Challenger banks are small, recently created retail banks that compete directly
with the longer-established banks in the country, sometimes by specialising in
areas underserved by the "big four" banks (Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking
Group, and NatWest Group).

See [challenger bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_bank) on Wikipedia.
