## Rone 34mm FHF ST-96 11.5'''
I think this might be my rite of passage.

Bought for 25 bucks four months ago, and _just_ had a slippy mainspring. So, I attempted a service and immediately the cannon pinion evaporated. Ordered a donor and broke _two_ escape wheel pinions on the rebuild. OK, ordered a second doner. When that arrived I serviced the keyless works and sent the yoke spring into orbit. No worries, I have another... also sent that one to the Moon. But wait... I found the first on my pants! Right, on the home stretch, located the case and movement spacer from months previous and it's back together, looking exactly like it did when I bought it! But I have grow as a human being.

## Omega 161.009
22190717 (1965), cal 552, rown very worn, can _just_ see the Omega logo, stem not engaging, rotor a little worn.

## Accurist Shockmaster
Hand winder G10, keeps great time, 34-hour power reserve.

## Mr. Jones "The Accurate"
An actual quartz repair!

£145 RRP -- see [website](https://mrjoneswatches.com/products/the-accurate) -- which is quite surprising given I bought a whole new movement _with_ battery for £9.
