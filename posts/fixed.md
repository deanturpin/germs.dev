# Fixed watches

## Molnija 3602 marriage watch
See [Ranfft](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&2&2uswk&Molnia_3602) and [Linux Focus](http://cgi.linuxfocus.org/~guido/molnija-pocket-watch/) for movement details.

I started out just trying to fix a pocket watch using another as a donor, but I managed to break both balances so I bought a third one to build the marriage watch. The others I'll sell or use as spares.

## Rone 34mm FHF ST-96 11.5'''
I think this might be my rite of passage.

Bought for 25 bucks four months ago, and it _just_ had a slippy mainspring. So, I attempted a service and immediately the cannon pinion evaporated. Ordered a donor and broke _two_ escape wheel pinions on the rebuild. OK, ordered a second doner. When that arrived I serviced the keyless works and sent the yoke spring into orbit. No worries, I have another... also sent that one to the Moon. But wait... I found the first on my pants! Right, on the home stretch, located the case and movement spacer from months previous and it's back together, looking exactly like it did when I bought it! But I have grow as a human being.

## Omega 161.009
22190717 (1965), cal 552, rown very worn, can _just_ see the Omega logo, stem not engaging, rotor a little worn.

- [x] Service (external)
- [x] New leather strap

## Accurist Shockmaster
Hand winder G10, keeps great time, 34-hour power reserve.

- [x] Buff case
- [x] Add crocodile leather strap

## Mr. Jones "The Accurate"
An actual quartz repair!

£145 RRP -- see [website](https://mrjoneswatches.com/products/the-accurate) -- which is quite surprising given I bought a whole new movement _with_ battery for £9.

- [x] Replace battery -- still not running
- [x] Ordered new Ronda 513
- [x] Replace coil, hands very difficult to remove
