# Repaired watches

## Omega 161.009
- 22190717 (1965), cal 552
- Crown very worn, can _just_ see the Omega logo
- After-market gold-plated bracelet
- Stem not engaging
- Rotor a little worn

- [x] Service (external)
- [x] New leather strap

## Accurist Shockmaster
Hand winder G10, keeps great time, 34-hour power reserve.

- [x] Buff case
- [x] Add crocodile leather strap

## Mr. Jones "The Accurate"
An actual quartz repair!

£145 RRP -- see [website](https://mrjoneswatches.com/products/the-accurate) -- which is quite surprising given I bought a whole new movement _with_ battery for £9.

- [x] Replace battery -- still not running
- [x] Ordered new Ronda 513
- [x] Replace coil, hands very difficult to remove
