# Fixed watches

## Omega 161.009
22190717 (1965), cal 552, rown very worn, can _just_ see the Omega logo, stem not engaging, rotor a little worn.

- [x] Service (external)
- [x] New leather strap

## Accurist Shockmaster
Hand winder G10, keeps great time, 34-hour power reserve.

## Mr. Jones "The Accurate"
An actual quartz repair!

£145 RRP -- see [website](https://mrjoneswatches.com/products/the-accurate) -- which is quite surprising given I bought a whole new movement _with_ battery for £9.

- [x] Replace battery -- still not running
- [x] Ordered new Ronda 513
- [x] Replace coil, hands very difficult to remove
