# C++ experience and side-projects

Commercially I develop using C++17, therefore I maintain various side-projects on GitLab to explore new C++ features. These projects include audio processing, trading strategy back-testing and OpenAI.

I'm an advocate of ad-hoc scripting for rapid development of ideas, and I believe a solid foundation in ubiquitous languages like Bash and Python is essential in CI and cloud computing. I also have an interest in a more functional approach to programming offered by template metaprogramming and Haskell.
