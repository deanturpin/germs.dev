# C++ experience and side-projects

Commercially I develop using C++17, therefore I maintain various
side-projects on GitLab to explore new C++ features. These projects include audio processing, trading strategy back-testing and Companies
House analysis.

I'm an advocate of ad-hoc scripting for rapid development of ideas, and I
believe a solid foundation in a ubiquitous language such as Bash is essential
in CI and cloud computing. I also have an interest in a more functional
approach to programming offered by template metaprogramming and languages such
as Haskell.

## Example projects

- Discrete Fourier Transforms in C++23: `dft.germs.dev`
- Command line assembly explorer: `explore.germs.dev`
- FIX processing: `fix.germs.dev`
- C++ best practice: `turpin.dev`
- Online logbook: `turpin.one`
- Companies House plotter: `bank.germs.dev`
- Architectural Blender renders: `render.germs.dev`
- Skills timeline generator (see image below): `gitlab.com/deanturpin/skills`
- My bash aliases `germs.dev`
- Essential Linux apps: `turpin.cloud`
- C++ compiler flags of choice: `g++ main.cxx $(curl -L flags.germs.dev)`
