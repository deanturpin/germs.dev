# C++ experience and side-projects

Commercially I develop using C++17, therefore I maintain various side-projects
on GitLab to explore new C++ features. These projects include audio processing,
trading strategy back-testing and Companies House analysis.

I'm an advocate of ad-hoc scripting for rapid development of ideas, and I
believe a solid foundation in ubiquitous languages like Bash and Python is
essential in CI and cloud computing. I also have an interest in a more
functional approach to programming offered by template metaprogramming and
languages such as Haskell.

## Example projects

- Discrete Fourier Transforms in C++23: `dft.germs.dev`
- C++ best practice: `turpin.dev`
- Energy usage calculations in Haskell: `energy.turpin.cloud`
- FIX processing: `fix.germs.dev`
- Container training material: `benchmark.germs.dev`
- Online logbook: `turpin.one`
