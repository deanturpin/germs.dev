# C++ experience and side-projects

Commercially I develop using C++17, so I feel it is important to explore the latest C++ features in my personal projects. These cover subjects such as trading strategy backtesting, audio processing, data visualisation and OpenAI. I'm an advocate of ad-hoc scripting for rapid development of ideas, and I believe a solid foundation in ubiquitous languages like Bash and Python is essential in CI and cloud computing. I also have an interest in a more functional approach offered by compile-time programming, and I consider profiling and benchmarking an integral and continuous part of the development process for low-latency applications.

Currently a reviewer/TE on an unpublished C++ book aimed at junior developers.
