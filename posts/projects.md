# C++ experience and side-projects

Commercially I develop using C++17, so I feel it is important to explore the latest C++ features in my personal projects. I usually track the latest Ubuntu Docker image (ubuntu/devel) and my laptop is kept as up-to-date as possible without compiling from source (24.04).

Projects cover subjects such as trading strategy backtesting, PCAP processing, audio and OpenAI. I believe a solid foundation in ubiquitous languages such as Bash and Python is essential in CI and cloud computing; I have an interest in a more functional approach offered by compile-time programming; and I consider profiling and benchmarking an integral and continuous part of the development process for low-latency applications.

Currently a reviewer/TE on an unpublished C++ book aimed at junior developers.
