# Agile tldr

Ten steps to happiness.

| Too long | Didn't read |
|-|-|
| Do the hard bit first | It feels like progress picking those "low hanging fruit" but you've still got to chop that tree down |
| Release automatically every sprint | Otherwise it will become your full-time job |
| Do the bits that improve users' lives right now | And "users" could be the devops team, but somebody else needs to be using it |
| Stop doing the bits that nobody asked for | It may have seemed like a good idea once, but so do lots of things; obviously products need guidance and vision, but don't be afraid of abandoning something that isn't actually useful |
| Eat your own dog food | If you're not using your software to do a job, then you're not testing it |
| Dev, scrum master and product owner are different roles for >1 person | When you've under pressure fixing some code, the other roles are guaranteed to suffer |
| Plan and estimate as a team | There's no I in Agile |
| Standup: what I did yesterday, what I'm doing today, any blockers | Extended discussions must be between interested parties only and after the standup |
| Estimate in complexity | Humans good at comparing task sizes; time-based estimates only work if you've done exactly the same job before |
| 10% of your time should be refining the backlog | |

## Complexities

If you roughly break down a task, it's quite nice to order the sub-tasks in terms of complexity. And it helps direct you to which bits need breaking down further. Once they are broken down, they are more likely to be shared between the team: we are empowering the team to select tasks, not handing out jobs to individuals. Similarly, the total complexity points is the only metric that is reported; not who did the most.

A low complexity task is unlikely to be blocked or prolonged by the unforeseen/unknown; a 13-point task with no detail has an increased likelihood of slipping into the next sprint. But when a task is incomplete, always re-estimate: we are measuring how good we are at completing what we promised; otherwise you just end up tracking the inexorable passage of time.
