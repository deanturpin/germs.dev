# Agile tldr

| Too long | Didn't read |
|-|-|
| Do the hard bit first | It feels like progress picking those "low hanging fruit" but you've still got to chop that tree down |
| Release automatically every sprint | Otherwise it will become somebody's full-time job |
| Do the bits that improve endusers actual jobs right now | |
| Stop doing the bits that nobody needs | |
| Dev, scrum master and product owner are different roles for >1 person | When you've under pressure developing the others would suffer |
