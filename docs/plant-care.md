## Core Principles

1. **Underwater rather than overwater** – most houseplants die from too much water, not too little
2. **Drainage is critical** – pots must have holes, soil must be free-draining
3. **Callus before planting** – succulent and cactus cuttings need time to seal the wound
4. **Patience pays off** – propagation takes weeks to months, not days
5. **Light matters** – match the plant's natural habitat (desert vs forest floor)
