# Making the most of your annual leave in the UK

# How to Maximise Annual Leave in the UK 🇬🇧

The key idea is to **bridge bank holidays and weekends** so that a small number of leave days unlocks long stretches of time off.

---

## 1. Build Around Bank Holidays
Most UK employees get **8 bank holidays** (sometimes included in your allowance).

The highest-value ones are:
- **Easter** (Friday + Monday)
- **Early May & Spring bank holidays**
- **Christmas & New Year**

These are your leverage points.

## 2. The Biggest Wins (Almost Every Year)

### 🟢 Easter (Best Return on Leave)
Take **4 days off** (Tue–Fri between Good Friday and Easter Monday)  
➡️ **10 days off in a row**

Usually the most efficient use of leave all year.

---

### 🟢 Christmas & New Year (Longest Stretch)
Take **3–5 days off** (depends how dates fall)  
➡️ **10–14 days off**

When Christmas and New Year fall mid-week, this is exceptional value.

---

### 🟢 May Bank Holidays
There are typically **two Mondays in May**.

Options:
- Take **4 days off (Tue–Fri)** after either bank holiday  
  ➡️ **9 days off**
- Take the **4 days between the two bank holidays**  
  ➡️ Often **10–11 days off**

Great for spring travel before peak summer prices.

---

## 3. Use “Bookend” Weeks
Avoid random single days.

- Take **Mon–Fri** → **9 days off**
- Take **Tue–Fri** around a Monday bank holiday → **9–10 days off**

---

## 4. Keep Some Leave for “Stealth Extensions”
Hold back **2–3 days** for:
- Extending a long weekend
- Tagging onto a work trip
- Turning a 3-day weekend into 5–6 days

This gives flexibility without breaking big plans.

---

## 5. Example: ~25 Days Annual Leave
A very efficient allocation might be:

- **4 days** → Easter (10 days off)
- **4–5 days** → Christmas/New Year (10–14 days off)
- **4 days** → May bank holiday (9–10 days off)
- **5 days** → One full Mon–Fri week (9 days off)
- **2–3 days** → Flexible extensions

➡️ **40–45+ days away from work** across the year.

---

## 6. Practical Tips People Forget
- Book early for Easter, May, and Christmas weeks
- Check carry-over rules (often 3–5 days allowed)
- Avoid school holidays if travel costs matter
- Remote/hybrid work? **Mon–Tue or Thu–Fri combos** can be especially powerful
