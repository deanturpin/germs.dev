## Terminology
> The bid–ask spread (also bid–offer or bid/ask and buy/sell in the case of a
> market maker) is the difference between the prices quoted (either by a single
> market maker or in a limit order book) for an immediate sale (ask) and an
> immediate purchase (bid) for stocks, futures contracts, options, or currency
> pairs in some auction scenario. The size of the bid–ask spread in a security
> is one measure of the liquidity of the market and of the size of the
> transaction cost.[1] If the spread is 0 then it is a frictionless asset.
