# Analogue synthesis

## Oscillators

Where the sound is generated. The oscillator creates a waveform, which is then shaped and modified by other components in the synthesizer.

- Sine
- Triangle
- Sawtooth
- Square
- Pulse
- Noise
- Sample and hold
- White noise

## Mixer

Blends the signals from different sources together. It can also add effects like reverb or delay.

- Linear
- Exponential
- Logarithmic
- Ring modulator
- Phase modulator
- Amplitude modulator
- Frequency modulator
- Wave folder

## Filter

Filters modify the sound by removing certain frequencies. They can be used to create a wide range of effects, from subtle tonal changes to extreme sound design.

- Low pass
- High pass
- Band pass
- Band stop
- Notch
- All pass
- Peaking
- Low shelf
- High shelf
- Formant
- Comb
- Moog ladder
- State variable
- Resonant
- Sallen-Key

## ADSR

ADSR is a common envelope generator used in synthesizers. It shapes the amplitude of a sound over time, creating a more natural and expressive sound.

- Attack: The time it takes for the sound to reach its maximum level after a note is played.
- Decay: The time it takes for the sound to drop to a sustain level after the attack
- Sustain: The level at which the sound remains after the decay
- Release: The time it takes for the sound to fade away after the note is released

## LFO

Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO) is used to modulate other parameters in the synthesizer. It can create vibrato, tremolo, and other effects.

- Sine
- Triangle
- Sawtooth
- Square
