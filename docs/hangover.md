# Hangover supplements

*Disclaimer: This is not medical advice. It has been compiled by Claude AI.*

I've been looking into the ingredients across three popular hangover supplements to understand what's actually in them and whether there are any concerns about mixing them.

## The Products

- **Happy Tuesday** – A UK-based supplement with four separate capsules (Rebalance, Reboot, Release, Restore)
- **Myrkl** – A probiotic-based supplement from Sweden
- **Upside** – A Korean herbal jelly

## Potential Concerns When Mixing

### Direct Overlaps

| Compound | Products | Combined Amount | Concern |
|----------|----------|-----------------|---------|
| L-Cysteine / N-Acetyl L-Cysteine | Myrkl + Happy Tuesday | ? + 200mg | Same amino acid, different forms |

### Functionally Similar (Adaptogens/Stimulants)

| Compound | Product | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| American Ginseng | Happy Tuesday | Stimulating adaptogen |
| Kudzu | Upside | Can have sedative effects |
| Ashwagandha | Happy Tuesday | Adaptogen |
| Rhodiola | Happy Tuesday | Stimulating adaptogen |
| Poria Mushroom | Upside | Calming adaptogen |

Stacking multiple adaptogens can amplify effects unpredictably – some are stimulating, others calming.

### Liver Support Compounds

| Compound | Product |
|----------|---------|
| Hovenia Dulcis (DHM) | Upside |
| Artichoke Extract | Happy Tuesday |
| Alpha Lipoic Acid | Happy Tuesday |
| N-Acetyl L-Cysteine | Happy Tuesday |
| Curcumin | Happy Tuesday |

These all support liver function and detox pathways – probably fine together but worth noting the overlap in mechanism.

### Other Considerations

- **5-HTP** (Happy Tuesday) – avoid if taking SSRIs or other serotonergic supplements
- **Liquorice** (Upside) – can raise blood pressure with regular use
- **Ginseng + Ashwagandha + Rhodiola** – triple-stacking adaptogens may be overstimulating for some

## Notes on RDI Values

- Beta-Carotene RDI calculated as vitamin A equivalent (~625mcg RAE vs 800mcg RDI)
- The 313% RDI shown on Happy Tuesday's label for Magnesium appears to be an error; 112mg elemental magnesium is approximately 30% of the 375mg RDI
- The 182% RDI shown for Selenium also seems high for 10mcg; the typical RDI is 55mcg, making 10mcg approximately 18%
- Amino acids, antioxidants, herbal extracts, and probiotics don't have established RDIs
- Upside doesn't publish specific dosages for their herbal blend
