## 🪴 Soil Mixes (Using What You Have)

### Jade (established)

* **60–70% coir / 20–30% perlite / 0–20% vermiculite**
* Goal: fast drainage, light moisture buffer

### Haworthia

* **60–70% coir / 30–40% perlite**
* Goal: very airy, crown stays dry

### ZZ Plant (recommended)

* **50% coir / 40% perlite / 10% vermiculite**
* If you overwater: drop vermiculite to **5%** or skip

---

## 🌿 Fertiliser Rules (What to Use & When)

**General rules:**

* Never fertilise stressed or freshly repotted plants
* Feed only during active growth (spring–summer)
* Always dilute more than the label suggests

### What you have

* **General purpose:** ✅ Best overall

  * Use **¼ strength**, **monthly max**
* **Seaweed:** 👍 Occasional tonic

  * **¼ strength**, every **2–3 months**
* **Chilli fertiliser:** 🚫 Skip for succulents

  * Too nitrogen‑heavy; promotes soft growth

---

## 💧 Watering Mindset (Applies to All Three)

> **Dry → soak → drain → ignore**

* Trust **leaf firmness** (jade), **crown dryness** (haworthia), and **firm stems + light pot** (ZZ)
* Ignore moisture meters unless they read **bone dry** at depth
* Winter = water far less

---

## 🧠 One‑Line Mantras

* **Jade:** On top, dry, ignored
* **Haworthia:** Dry crown, bright shade, patience
* **ZZ:** If there’s a rhizome, there’s hope
