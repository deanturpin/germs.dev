### Why You're Seeing Higher Minimums

The $10K requirements you're seeing likely reflect that you're now dealing with:

- **Business banking accounts** designed for handling larger sums
- **Trust or fiduciary accounts** meant for holding money on behalf of others
- **Investment accounts** where you might grow the funds before donating

These accounts often have higher minimums because they assume you're managing substantial amounts.

### Key Issues to Consider

**Tax implications** - You'll likely need to report this income and potentially pay taxes on any interest/growth before donating. The group might need to get an EIN (tax ID number).

**Legal structure** - You're essentially running an informal charitable fund. Consider whether you need to:

- Form a simple LLC or other entity
- Set up formal agreements about decision-making
- Establish clear record-keeping processes

**Liability protection** - Having a formal structure protects individual members from personal liability.

### Practical Suggestions

- **Short term**: A high-yield business savings account might work while you sort things out
- **Consider a fiscal sponsor**: Some established nonprofits will manage funds for projects like yours for a small fee
- **Donor-advised funds**: Companies like Fidelity Charitable let you deposit funds and then recommend grants to various charities
- **Get professional help**: An accountant familiar with charitable giving could save you headaches

### UK-Specific Considerations

VAT registration - With ongoing T-shirt sales, you may need to register for VAT if you expect to exceed £85K annually

Business structure - You probably want to formalize this as:

Community Interest Company (CIC)
Limited company with charitable objects
Or partner with an existing charity as fiscal sponsor
