After over a decade on Linux (and a bit of Windows).

##Â Homebrew

Firstly... there's no default package manager like apt! But there is Homebrew, which is kind of a drop-in replacement for `apt`. Well, it behaves similarly.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew update
```

### Apps to install

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Tidal](https://offer.tidal.com/download?lang=en)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=darwinarm64)

### Command line installs

Via `brew`.

```bash
brew install duf tmux vim neofetch google-benchmark stats entr watch ag fzf libpcap nmap threads google-benchmark jq
```

## RAM usage

Based on a proportion of 16GB RAM.

| Application | Typical RAM usage (%) |
|-|-|
| Baseline (nothing running) | 30 |
| Tidal | 5 |
| Chrome (20 tabs) | 12 |
