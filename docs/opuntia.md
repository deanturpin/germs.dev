# How to Propagate Opuntia microdasys from Cuttings (UK Winter Edition)

*Also known as the Bunny Ears Cactus*

Opuntia microdasys is one of the easiest cacti to propagate — even in a UK winter — as long as you control **moisture, light, and temperature**. If you’ve got a grow lamp, you’re already halfway there.

This guide walks through a reliable, low-risk method for rooting pads indoors during the colder months.

---

## What You’ll Need

- A healthy Opuntia microdasys pad  
- Gloves or tongs (the glochids are brutal)
- Small pot with drainage holes
- Free-draining cactus soil
- Perlite / pumice / coarse sand
- Grow lamp
- Optional: seedling heat mat

---

## Step 1: Take the Cutting

- Gently **twist or snap off** a healthy pad at the joint  
- No knife needed
- Choose a pad that’s firm, green, and unblemished

⚠️ **Do not touch with bare hands** — the tiny barbed glochids are far worse than normal spines.

---

## Step 2: Let the Pad Callus

This step prevents rot and is non-negotiable.

- Place the pad in a **dry, shaded, well-ventilated spot**
- Leave it for **5–10 days**
- The broken edge should feel **dry and slightly corky**

Never plant a fresh cut.

---

## Step 3: Prepare the Soil

Drainage matters more than nutrients.

**Recommended winter mix:**
- 60–70% cactus/succulent compost  
- 30–40% perlite, pumice, or coarse sand  

If your compost feels peat-heavy, increase the mineral content.

Use a **small pot** — oversized pots stay wet too long in winter.

---

## Step 4: Plant the Pad

- Insert the callused end **1–2 cm** into the soil
- Keep it upright (pebbles help)
- **Do not water**

Place the pot somewhere warm and stable.

---

## Step 5: Grow Light Setup

A grow lamp makes winter propagation viable.

- **12–14 hours per day**
- Light positioned **15–30 cm** above the pad
- Full-spectrum or white LED preferred

The pad should feel bright but not hot.

---

## Step 6: Warmth Helps (A Lot)

Root growth stalls in cold soil.

Ideal conditions:
- Room temperature: **18–22 °C**
- Optional: seedling heat mat on low
- Avoid cold windowsills at night

Warm roots = faster rooting.

---

## Step 7: Watering (Be Conservative)

This is where most failures happen.

- Wait **10–14 days after planting**
- Then give a **very small amount of water**
- After that, water **only when the soil is completely dry**

In UK winter conditions, this may mean watering just **once every 3–4 weeks**.

---

## How Long Does Rooting Take?

- Winter rooting: **4–6 weeks**
- Sometimes longer — no visible growth is normal

Signs of success:
- Resistance when gently nudged
- Pad remains firm and plump
- New pad growth (often in early spring)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Watering too early  
❌ Heavy, water-retentive soil  
❌ Cold, damp rooms  
❌ Full sun before rooting  
❌ Handling without protection  

---

## Spring Transition

As daylight increases:
- Gradually increase watering
- Move closer to a bright window
- Acclimate slowly to real sunlight (this species sunburns easily)

---

## Final Thoughts

Opuntia microdasys doesn’t need much — just **dry roots, bright light, and patience**. With a grow lamp and restraint on watering, winter propagation in the UK is completely achievable.

If in doubt: **wait longer and water less**.

Happy growing 🌵
