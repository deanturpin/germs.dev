# Website Hosting

On the cheap...
> tl;dr -- currently using GitLab for hosting and Cloudflare for DNS

## Hugo
So this whole site is generated from markdown using the Hugo blog engine. And
it's hosted on GitLab completely free. See how [I did it](/post/hugo). This
does really need settiing up from a softie, but once it's in place you an edit
and add articles within in the browser.

## 000webhost / Hostinger
Free hosting is available from 000webhost -- albeit with an advert. But you can
go pro for as little as $2 a month.

It did amuse me that I hit two verification issues on the registration page!
