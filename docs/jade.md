# Jade Plant Trunk-Thickening & Bonsai Guide 🌳

## Goal
Encourage a jade plant (Crassula ovata) to develop:
- A **thick, woody trunk**
- Compact branching
- A tree / bonsai-style silhouette

This takes **light, pruning, mild stress, and time**.

---

## 1. Choose the Main Trunk

- Select **one central, thickest stem** to be the future trunk
- Remove or separate competing stems so energy isn’t split
- Extra stems can be:
  - Repotted as new plants, or
  - Pruned back hard to become branches

**Rule:** one leader = faster thickening.

---

## 2. Pruning (The Most Important Step)

### When
- Spring or summer only

### How
- Cut **just above a leaf pair (node)**
- Reduce tall stems by **⅓–½**
- Leave **3–4 leaf pairs above the soil** on the main trunk

### What Happens
- New shoots grow from **nodes below the cut**
- Usually 2–4 branches appear
- The trunk thickens to support new growth

**The cut top itself will not regrow leaves — growth comes from below.**

---

## 3. Light (Gym Time)

### Ideal
- 3–5 hours of direct sun daily, or
- Strong grow light

### Grow Light Setup
- 15–30 cm above canopy
- 10–12 hours/day
- Combine with window light if possible

**Good signs**
- Compact leaves
- Slight red edges

**Bad signs**
- Stretching → move light closer
- Pale/yellow → raise light slightly

Rotate pot weekly.

---

## 4. Watering (Mild Stress = Wood)

- Let soil dry **completely** between waterings
- Water deeply, then leave it alone
- Occasional slight leaf wrinkling is OK

Avoid frequent small sips.

---

## 5. Pot Size Strategy

### Right Now
- Medium-depth pot is ideal
- Don’t up-pot unless roots are very crowded

### Shallow / Bonsai Pots
- Excellent for jade **later**
- Restricts roots → thickens trunk
- Improves proportions

**Timing:** move to shallow pot after:
- Trunk starts turning woody
- Strong branching is established
- Roots fill current pot

Usually **6–12 months after major pruning**.

---

## 6. Repotting into a Shallow Pot (Later)

1. Remove plant when soil is dry
2. Gently comb roots outward
3. Trim roots by **20–30%**
4. Use a wide, shallow pot with drainage
5. Gritty succulent soil
6. No watering for 5–7 days

---

## 7. 12-Month Trunk-Thickening Plan

### Spring
- Major prune
- Increase light
- Minimal watering during recovery

### Summer
- Maximum light
- Let it grow freely
- Water only when fully dry

### Late Summer / Early Autumn
- Light shaping prune if needed
- Shorten long shoots

### Autumn
- Reduce watering
- Stop fertilizing

### Winter
- Bright light
- Cool-ish conditions
- Very little water
- No pruning

### Next Spring
- Second grow-and-chop
- Noticeable trunk thickening begins

Repeat yearly for serious gains.

## 8. Pro Tricks

- Let the canopy get slightly heavy (don’t over-stake)
- Weight encourages trunk thickening
- Angle cuts slightly to encourage multiple shoots
- Fertilize lightly, spring/summer only

---

## Mindset
Jades reward **confidence and patience**.
If it looks a bit brutal right after pruning — that’s correct.

Think in **years**, not weeks 🌳
