## Terminology
> Derivatives trading is the practice of buying and selling financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset. These instruments are used to hedge risk, speculate, and generate income. Common derivatives include futures, options, swaps, and forwards. Derivatives trading can be complex and risky, so it is important to understand the risks involved before entering into any transactions.

Swaps strategy:

> Swaps trading is a strategy that involves entering into an agreement to exchange one type of asset for another at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined price. This strategy is used by investors to hedge their exposure to certain risks, such as interest rate risk, currency risk, and commodity price risk. Swaps can be used to speculate on the direction of the underlying asset or to hedge against potential losses. Swaps can also be used to gain exposure to assets that may not be available in the investor's home market.

Market liquidity:

> Market makers are financial institutions or individual traders that provide liquidity to the markets by continuously buying and selling securities. They are responsible for setting bid and ask prices, and they make money by collecting the spread between the two prices. Market makers also provide market depth, which is the ability to buy and sell large amounts of a security without significantly affecting its price. They also help to reduce volatility in the markets by providing liquidity and absorbing large orders.
