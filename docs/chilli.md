# Chilli Growing Guide (Coco Coir Based)

This is a practical, no-nonsense reference for growing chillies in **coco coir**, using **perlite, vermiculite, chilli feed, and seaweed**.

---

## 1. Coco Coir: Is it Suitable?

**Yes — coco coir is excellent for chillies.**

Chillies like:

* Airy roots
* Even moisture
* Consistent feeding

Coco provides all of this, with one catch: **it contains no nutrients**.

**Rules for success with coco:**

* Always add perlite
* Feed earlier and more consistently than compost
* Never let it dry out completely

---

## 2. Soil / Medium Mixes (by eye)

You do **not** need precise measurements. Mix by eye in a tray, bucket, or bag.

### Seed starting

* 70% coco coir
* 30% vermiculite

Purpose: moisture retention and gentle root contact.

---

### Seedlings (true leaves showing)

* 60% coco coir
* 20% vermiculite
* 20% perlite

Purpose: balance moisture with oxygen.

---

### Young & mature plants

* 60% coco coir
* 30% perlite
* 10% vermiculite

Purpose: fast drainage, high oxygen, steady moisture buffer.

**Sanity check (squeeze test):**

* Falls apart when poked = perfect
* Streams water = too wet
* Dusty = too dry

---

## 3. Vermiculite: When to Use It

Vermiculite:

* Holds water
* Holds nutrients
* Releases both slowly

Use it **lightly**.

### Good uses

* Seeds & seedlings
* Coco-based mixes
* Fine-rooted plants
* As insurance against missed watering

### Avoid or minimise

* Succulents & cacti
* Mediterranean herbs
* Plants that hate wet roots

**Rule:** perlite first, vermiculite second.

---

## 4. Watering Chillies in Coco

### What *not* to rely on alone

* Drip tray dryness

A dry tray does not guarantee the root zone needs water.

### Better rule

Water when:

* Drip tray is dry **and**
* Top 1–2 cm of medium is dry
* Pot feels lighter

### How to water

* Water slowly
* Stop at first runoff
* Empty tray after 10–15 minutes

**Avoid:**

* Tiny daily sips
* Letting coco go bone-dry

---

## 5. Feeding Overview

### Key idea

* **Fertiliser = food**
* **Seaweed = stress support**

Seaweed is not a fertiliser.

---

## 6. Feeding Calendar (Simple)

### Seeds (0–2 weeks)

* Feed: none
* Seaweed: none

---

### Seedlings

* Chilli fertiliser: ¼ strength every 10–14 days
* Seaweed: ¼ strength every 3 weeks (optional)

---

### Young plants (15–30 cm)

* Chilli fertiliser: ½ strength weekly
* Seaweed: every 3–4 weeks

---

### First flowers

* Chilli fertiliser: weekly (½–¾ strength)
* Seaweed: one dose at flower onset

---

### Fruiting

* Chilli fertiliser: weekly
* Seaweed: only if stressed

---

## 7. When to Use What

### Use fertiliser when:

* Growth is slow
* Leaves are pale
* Plant is actively growing or fruiting

### Use seaweed when:

* After potting on
* After temperature stress
* Flowers are dropping
* Plant looks sulky but green

### Use neither when:

* Soil is soggy
* Roots are unhappy

Fix water first.

---

## 8. Symptom Decoder

### Leaf signals

* Pale green: needs more feed
* Dark green, no flowers: too much nitrogen
* Yellow lower leaves: underfeeding (common in coco)

---

### Root signals

* Droopy leaves + wet soil: overwatering
* Sudden collapse: root rot
* Curling leaves + dry medium: too dry

---

### Flower & fruit issues

* Flower drop: stress or inconsistent watering
* Split fruit: irregular watering

---

## 9. Ericaceous Compost

Ericaceous compost is **acidic**.

### Good for

* Blueberries
* Rhododendron
* Azalea
* Camellia
* Magnolia
* Acer

### Not ideal for

* Chillies
* Tomatoes
* Most houseplants

### Safe mixed use

* Max 10–20% of a blend
* Only if you want to gently lower pH

## 10. Core Principles to Remember

* Coco wants **consistency**
* Perlite prevents rot
* Vermiculite buffers mistakes
* Feed little and often
* Seaweed is occasional, not routine

> Healthy roots solve most problems
