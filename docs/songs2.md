# Stronger -- Sugababes
Note the interesting Am to A change and then back again. You can also play around with Am7 and F7. The interlude is a Dm but with a descending root and an extra bar just for fun.

Repeat the first block twice, then the interlude, followed by two more choruses and finish on the A.
