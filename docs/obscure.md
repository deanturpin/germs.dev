# Security through absurdity

It was recently suggested that I consider "using unusual ports" at work as a
security measure. After I got my breath back I found these quotes.

> Security experts have rejected this view as far back as 1851.

Historical perspective:

> Rogues are very keen in their profession, and know already much more than we
> can teach them.

Modern principle:

> System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its
> components.
