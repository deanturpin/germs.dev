## Cloud9 versus Google Cloud SSH
- Google's is slightly slicker, more tightly integrated with the instance
browser.
- The Google web SSH client is so close to the real thing that you quickly
forget what's going on.
- Cloud9 IDE is quite nice, Sublime-style editor. But slightly odd ctrl codes
remind you that you're not actually typing into a real terminal.
- Cloud computing lets you put a price on solving a complex problem such as
cracking a complex password.

## Exploit location
With cloud computing you can run your code where it gives you an advantage,
often communication latency.

## Backups
Your backup strategy should be proportion to the cost of recreating lost data.
Similarly encryption strength should be proportional to the sensitivity of the
data.
